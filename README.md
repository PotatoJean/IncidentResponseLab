<h1>Incident Response Labs</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This is a compilation of different Incident Response Labs I have done in a virtual environment. These labs are completed to familiarize myself with the process of incident response and investigation.</br>
</br>


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>VMWare Virtual Box</b>
- <b>Various Virtual Environment</b>

<h2>Incident Response Tools Used</h2>

- <b>D-Safe (Webshell Detector and Removal)</b>
- <b>Process Hacker</b>
- <b>PC Hunter</b>
- <b>Everything</b>
- <b>Huorong Sword</b>
- <b>Everything</b>
- <b>Notepad++</b>
- <b>Event Viewer (Windows)</b>
- <b>Task Manager (Windows)</b>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The labs listed below will follow the general guidance of incident response steps introduced by NIST. <br/>

<h2>Conclusion/ Lesson Learned</h2>
<p>
 <p>In most cases, attackers will try to maintain persistent connection with the affected host machine for any sort of malicious gains, be it ransomware, access to malicious domain, webshell etc. One common scenario I have notice is attackers tend to leave some files that have names that attempt to imitate a legitimate file or application. This is done so to disguise itself as normal application which can be mistakenly executed by users without much security experience. </br></p>

 <p>I understand that in a real life situation, incident response investigation will not be as smooth as the ones done in a virtual environment. An actual, skilled attacker will not clumsily leave traces of their malicious actions behind before they leave. </br></p>

<p>After the completion of these labs. I am aware that incident response report need not to be too detailed and long, as long as they serve their purpose, which is to discover the entry point of the attacker and time frames of the incident. In simpler terms, an incident response report should tell a story, instead of trying to remediate the damages done to the affected machine.</br></p>
